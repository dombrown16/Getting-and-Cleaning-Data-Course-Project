# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The data set for this project can be found here:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

I will create an R Script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The following files can be found as a part of this project:

1. README.md: A basic explanation of the project.
2. CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
3. run_analysis.R: The script that performs all the tasks of the project.
